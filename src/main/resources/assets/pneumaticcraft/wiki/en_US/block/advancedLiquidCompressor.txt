The Advanced Liquid Compressor is a machine which can [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/generatingPressure}]produce compressed air[link{}]. It's the upgraded version of the [link{block/liquidCompressor}]Liquid Compressor[link{}]. It by default generates 50ml/tick and can resist up to 20 bar. It can be upgraded with Speed Upgrades. However, the machine needs to be [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}] cooled[link{}], as the efficiency will drop as the temperature rises, up to the point where no air is generated at all. Therefore the machine could be used just to create heat.
