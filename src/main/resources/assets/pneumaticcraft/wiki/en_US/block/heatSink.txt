The Heat Sink is a block used to get rid of [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}]heat [link{}]. It has a reasonably low resistance to the air, which is used to get rid of the heat. Its general purpose is to help cool down compressors which create heat.

Heat Sinks are only connecting heat wise on the single solid side of the Heat Sink. So to connect up a row of Heat Sinks, conductors like a [link{block/compressedIronBlock}]Blocks of Compressed Iron[link{}] are required.

You can increase the effectiveness of a Heat Sink by placing it in range of an [link{item/airGrateModule}]Air Grate Module[link{}]. The range is displayed when you place down an Air Grate Tube. The effectiveness can be stacked by using multiple Air Grate Modules.
