[prefix{l}]The Coordinate piece [prefix{}]
The Coordinate is a piece solely used as parameter for other pieces. This piece comes into play when dealing with [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/coordinateOperator}]Relative Coordinates[link{}].

The Coordinate piece could be compared to the [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/area}]Area piece[link{}]. With the Area piece you're supplying two coordinates to make up an area. With this piece you're just supplying one. There are two ways to supply a coordinate:

Constant
A constant coordinate is... constant. You can select one by selecting a GPS Tool, or typing it in the text boxes manually.

Variable
By selecting Variable you can return the value stored in the variable as the coordinate. [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/coordinateOperator}]Click here[link{}] to read more about variables.
Keep in mind that with this you can only supply a coordinate, not modify it!
