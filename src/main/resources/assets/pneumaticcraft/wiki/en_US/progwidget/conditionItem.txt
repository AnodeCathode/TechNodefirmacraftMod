This is a Condition. [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/conditions}]Click here[link{}] to read general information about Conditions.

The Condition: Item Filter piece allows you to compare Item Filters. This is mostly useful when you are using Item Filters with variables.

[prefix{l}]Basic usage[prefix{}]
The piece will take a single Item Filter piece placed on the right, and take its item. The filter options (like OreDictionary) are not used. It will then check if the item matches the filter specified by item filters on the second row. Like always, on the right hand side to whitelist (meaning this items should match this filter), and left side blacklist (saying that this item should NOT match this filter). If it passes the filter, the condition is evaluated true. If not, the condition is evaluated false.

[prefix{l}]Advanced usage[prefix{}]
You can add more than one item to check. By connecting multiple item filters on the right hand site, the condition will only evaluate true if ALL items match the filter. Item Filters placed on the left hand side should NOT match the filter to let the condition to be evaluated true.
