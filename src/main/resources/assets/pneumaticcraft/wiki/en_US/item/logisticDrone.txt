[prefix{l}]Logistic Drone [prefix{}]

Logistic Drones are a special type of [link{item/drone}]drone [link{}]. They are a lower tier Drone. As a result of this they are limited in what they can do. Still they are reasonably powerful even though they can't be programmed.
[crafting{200,90,key=item/logisticDrone}]












Logistic Drones are heavily based on [link{www.factorioforums.com/wiki/index.php?title=Logistic_network}]Factorio's Logistics system[link{}]. Instead of having different logistic Chests, Logistic Frames are a thing. These frames can be crafted and framed around any inventory/tank by right clicking the inventory/tank. The following frames exist:

-Logistic Passive Provider Frame, provides items/fluids to Requester Frames. Can be configured to supply only certain items/fluids.
[crafting{200,305,key=item/logisticFramePassiveProvider}]
-Logistic Active Provider Frame, provides items/fluids to Storage Frames and Requester Frames. Can be configured to supply only certain items/fluids.
[crafting{200,455,key=item/logisticFrameActiveProvider}]
-Logistic Storage Frame, a place for items/fluids to be stored that are not requested. Also provides to the logistics network. Can be configured to only supply/accept certain items/fluids.

-Logistic Requester Frame, can be configured to keep a certain amount of items/fluids supplied in the framed inventory.

Any Logistic Frame in a 16 block range from the location where the Logistic Drone was placed down originally will be looked up. The following rules will be applied, ordered from high to low priority:
1. Items/fluids from Provider Frames are transported to Requester Frames which ask for the items and can store them.
2. Items/fluids from Storage Frames are transported to Requester Frames which ask for the items and can store them.
3. Items/fluids from Active Provider Frames are transported to Storage frames which can store the items.

[prefix{l}]Item/fluid filtering[prefix{}]
By right-clicking a Logistic Frame item on anything other than an inventory/tank or by right clicking an existing frame with a [link{item/logisticsConfigurator}]Logistics Configurator[link{}] an interface will open. By leaving the interface empty, any item/liquid is allowed by the filter. Or when it's concerning a Requester Frame, nothing will be requested. When having an item/fluid in a slot, only that item is allowed to be provided/stored. Requester frames will request that item and amount. The amount can be adjusted by right clicking to increase or left clicking to decrease the amount. For more info open up the 'Slot interaction' tab.

Logistic behaviour can also be acquired by normal [link{item/drone}]Drones [link{}]. A [link{pneumaticcraft:progwidget/logistics}]Logistics command [link{}] exists for this purpose.

(Logistics) Drones need compressed air. You can charge Drones in a [link{block/chargingStation}]Charging Station [link{}]. Now, when you place down a charged Logistics Drone, it will execute the logistical task described above.

[prefix{l}]Automatic charging [prefix{}]
Drones are smart. When they get low on air they'll search for a Charging Station with pressure that has a Dispenser Upgrade in it within the same dimension as the Drone. When found, the Drone will go to this Charging Station and it will stay charging until the Charging Station can't supply anymore. After that the Drone will continue executing logistical tasks.

On a multiplayer server you might want to only allow your Drones to charge on your Charging Station(s). You can make your Charging Station private by covering it by a [link{block/securityStation}]Security Station[link{}]. Now only the Drones that have been placed by players who are whitelisted in the Security Station will be allowed to charge. 

When the Drone's air runs out the propellers of the Drone will stop and the Drone falls straight to the ground.

[prefix{l}]Dyeing a Drone [prefix{}]
You can dye a Drone by putting a Drone in a crafting table together with a piece of dye. You can also craft a Drone in-world, by right clicking it with a piece of dye.
