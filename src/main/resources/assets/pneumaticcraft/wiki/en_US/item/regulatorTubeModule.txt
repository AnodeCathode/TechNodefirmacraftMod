This item is a [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/pressureTubes}]Tube Module[link{}]. this means that it can be placed on a Pressure Tube only. For general information about Tube Modules click the link.

The Regulator Tube Module is used to limit the pressure going through the tube. The threshold pressure is determined like the [link{item/safetyTubeModule}]Safety Valve Tube[link{}], which is by the formula:

[prefix{l}]Redstone strength = 15 - (2 x threshold pressure)[prefix{}]

When this threshold has been reached this tube won’t let gasses through anymore. This principal can be used as a 'transformer': On the input there are high pressurized gases. The Regulator Tube limits the pressure on the output to the threshold pressure. This allows a lower tiered network to be powered by a higher one.

[prefix{l}]One-way behaviour[prefix{}]
The Regulator tube will only regulate to one way, namely the direction it's pointing at. To the other side the gases are [prefix{l}]NOT [prefix{}] stopped! This can be used to create a one way valve.

[prefix{l}]Applying an    [link{item/advancedPCB}]Advanced PCB[link{}][prefix{}]
The Advanced PCB behaviour of the Regulator Tube Module is [prefix{n}]very [prefix{}]similar to that of the [link{item/safetyTubeModule}]Safety Valve Module[link{}]. I suggest to go to that linked page for info.
