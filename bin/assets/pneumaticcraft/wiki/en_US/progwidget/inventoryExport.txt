Programming Puzzles are used in [link{block/programmer}]programmers [link{}].

[prefix{l}]The 'Inv-E' (Inventory Export) piece [prefix{}]
The opposite of [link{item/programmingPuzzle_Inv-I}]Inventory Import [link{}]: The Drone will move to the nearest inventory within the specified area to drop off items from the Drone's inventory.

You can specify to which sides of the inventory the Drone should output its items by right clicking the 'Inv-E' piece. In here you can specify a maximum amount of exported items too.

You can also apply an item filter. With a filter, only items that are allowed by the filter will be exported by the Drone.

This program is done when the Drone's inventory is empty (of the by the item filter allowed items), or when there's no inventory within the area to output the items to.
