Programming Puzzles are used in [link{block/programmer}]programmers [link{}].

[prefix{l}]The 'Place' (Place Blocks) piece [prefix{}]
The Drone will place blocks from its inventory in the world. It will place blocks in the area specified and it will place blocks in locations that are the closest first.

You can control the order in which blocks are placed in some way. Right click the puzzle piece for this. You can specify if the Drone should place blocks layer by layer, and if so from top to bottom or vice versa.

[prefix{l}]Limiting blocks placed[prefix{}]
The amount of place actions can be limited to a specified amount by right clicking the Place piece. If set to 1 for example, the Drone will only place one block, and end the Place program after placing that one block.

[prefix{l}]Placing specific blocks[prefix{}]
Lastly you can specify which blocks from the Drone's inventory the Drone is allowed to place by adding an Item Filter.

This program is done when the area is completely filled with blocks, or when the Drone's inventory is empty of (allowed) blocks.
