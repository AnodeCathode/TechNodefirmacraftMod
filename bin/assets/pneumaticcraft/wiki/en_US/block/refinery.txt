A Refinery is a machine which is uses [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/heat}]heat [link{}] to refine Oil into various fuels. It starts to work at 100 degrees Celcius. The higher temperature applied, the faster it refines. All fuels that can be produced are, sorted from lightest to heaviest:

-LPG (Liquefied Petroleum Gas)
-Gasoline (equal to BuildCraft's Fuel)
-Kerosine
-Diesel

Refineries cannot operate with a single block: Multiple Refineries need to be stacked on top of each other to operate, ranging from 2 to 4 Refineries. Different amounts give different yields:

2 Refineries:
LPG         (2mB)
Diesel      (4mB)

3 Refineries:
LPG         (2mB)
Kerosine  (3mB)
Diesel      (2mB)

4 Refineries:
LPG         (2mB)
Gasoline   (3mB)
Kerosine  (3mB)
Diesel      (2mB)

The lightest fuel will always end up in the top Refinery, the heaviest in the bottom.

All produced liquids can be used as fuel in a [link{block/liquidCompressor}]Liquid Compressor[link{}]. However, the mean use of the fuels is to create plastic. A [link{block/thermopneumaticProcessingPlant}]Thermopneumatic Processing Plant[link{}] is used for this.
