The Charging Station is a machine in which pneumatic items can be charged (or discharged). The interaction between the Charging Station and pneumatic items is the same as for the interaction between tubes/machines: Differences in pressures are tried to equalize. This means that you'll need a highly pressurized Charging Station to charge items to a high pressure.

Most charged items have a maximum pressure of 10 bar. Don't worry for explosions though, items never can explode, they will simply stop charging beyond 10 bar.

[prefix{l}]Charge Pad[prefix{}]
You can turn the Charging Station into a Charge Pad by putting in a [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/machineUpgrades}]Dispenser Upgrade[link{}]. This will charge any items lying on top of the Station and/or items that are in a player's inventory who is standing on top of the Station.

This is a list of the current items that can be charged:
