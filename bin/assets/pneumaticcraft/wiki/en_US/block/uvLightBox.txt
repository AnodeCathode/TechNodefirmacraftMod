The UV Light Box is a machine in which you can expose [link{pneumaticcraft:menu/printedCircuitBoards}]PCB's [link{}] to UV light, at certain places (which is determined by the Blueprint laying on top of the PCB). The exposure process takes a maximum of 10 minutes. When you wait these full 10 minutes you'll have a 100% chance that the etching process (next step) will succeed. You can however expose the PCB for a shorter time, which will result in a lower chance of the PCB successfully being etched. The UV Light Box needs pressure to run, the tubes can't be connected to the front, back or top of the machine.
