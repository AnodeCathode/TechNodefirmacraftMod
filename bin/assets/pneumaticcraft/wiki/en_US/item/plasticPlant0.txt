[prefix{l}]Soil: [prefix{}]
Water

[prefix{l}]How to acquire in survival:[prefix{}]
Squid Plants are spawned on top of water in the Overworld. You can also acquire them by killing squids: Squids have a small chance to drop Squid Plant Seeds

[prefix{l}]full-grown behaviour:[prefix{}]
Spawning a Squid

[prefix{l}]propagation theory:[prefix{}]
The propagation theory relies on Squids being derpy. The Squid Plant spawns a squid, and because Squids are derpy they randomly take suffocation damage. When they die, they have a chance of dropping a new seed.
