[link{block/pressureTube}]Pressure Tubes[link{}] are used to transport compressed air. These tubes are compatible with ForgeMultiPart.

These are your tier one tubes, meaning they can resist up to 5 bar of pressure, nominally.

[crafting{200,200,key=block/pressureTube}]













When your infrastructure is ready for it, you can also make tier two tubes, Advanced Pressure Tubes. These can hold up to 20 bar of pressure. The only way to acquire these is using an Assembly Line. There are two variants you can use to craft the tubes:

[assemblyLine{200,400,block/advancedPressureTube}]

[assemblyLine{200,570,block/advancedPressureTube,1}]



































[prefix{l}]Modules [prefix{}]
To control your pressure network you can equip (Advanced) Pressure Tubes with so called Tube Modules. You can put modules on every side of a tube. Right click a Pressure Tube with a Tube Module in the world to place it.

There are two types of Tube Modules:
-In-line Tube Modules, which can be connected between two tubes. These generally block or measure air flow going through the tubes.
-Not-in-line Tube Modules, which when connected between two tubes will block a connection.
On the tooltip of a Tube Module you can see whether you're dealing with an in-line Tube Module or not.

[prefix{l}]Upgrading Modules[prefix{}]
You can upgrade a Tube Module by right clicking a Tube Module with an [link{item/advancedPCB}]Advanced PCB[link{}]. When you do so, it will use the Advanced PCB. When you right click again, a GUI opens. It differs per Tube Module what you can tweak. Generally it means you don't have to run an ugly line of redstone to adjust thresholds. Go to the page of the respective module to see what you can tweak.

The following is a list of all the Tube Modules, click on the module to navigate to the page.
